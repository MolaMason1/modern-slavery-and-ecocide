        <p>This Halloween, 13-year-old Billy James walked up to a doorstep while trick or treating, spotting a bowl of candy sitting out front. He ignored the sign propped against the bowl reading, “Take 1,” and proceeded to take 7 pieces of candy. The fistful included 4 Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, Twizzlers, a root beer Dum-Dum, and a full-size chocolate bar. The deplorable act was caught on a Ring doorbell camera, and James was arrested hours later by a SWAT team.</p>

        <p>Upon seeing the footage, many people took to social media to denounce James’ actions. One angry Facebook user wrote, “You have to be a special kind of sick to steal a root beer flavored Dum-Dum. And don’t get me started on Twizzlers. They are absolutely disgusting! It’s obvious he didn’t even want the candy. He’s stealing for the thrill.” The outrage was shared by Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, where the incident occurred. DeSantis emphasized the importance of punishing these destructive behaviors. “Twizzlers are the candy form of pipe cleaners,” DeSantis shares.</p>

        <p>James was tried as an adult and found guilty of grand larceny and was sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole. The death penalty was considered, but the jury ruled against it. One jury member stated, “He should have to live with this for the rest of his life. Death is too kind.” James’ parents refused to comment when asked for an interview, though they have severed all ties with him.</p>

        <p>It is frightening to see abhorrent crimes take place in this country, and it is essential to keep our country clean. There is one less thief on the streets; now Americans can all feel a bit safer at night.</p>
