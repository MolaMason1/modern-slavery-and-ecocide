            <strong>Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)</strong> by Marvin Gaye
            <p><em>This song expresses the growing concern about environmental destruction, pollution, and the damage people do to nature. By this reason, it represents a wider fight against ecocide.</em></p>
            <div class="lyrics">
                “Where did all the blue skies go?  
                Poison is the wind that blows  
                From the north, and south, and east.”  
                
                “Oh, things ain't what they used to be  
                Oil wasted on the ocean and upon our seas  
                Fish full of mercury, oh, oh, mercy, mercy me.”

            <strong>Slave Driver</strong> by Bob Marley

                It’s only a machine that make money."

    <h2>Poems on Modern Slavery and Ecocide</h2>
    <ul class="poem-list">
        <li class="poem-item">
            <strong>The Cry of the Children</strong> by Elizabeth Barrett Browning
            <p><em>This poem pulls from the image of suffering children working tirelessly each and every day. This fear and the reality of child labor still roams all across the world.</em></p>
            <div class="stanza">
                "For oh," say the children, "we are weary,  
                And we cannot run or leap —  
                If we cared for any meadows, it were merely  
                To drop down in them and sleep.  
                Our knees tremble sorely in the stooping —  
                We fall upon our faces, trying to go ;  
                And, underneath our heavy eyelids drooping,  
                The reddest flower would look as pale as snow.  
                For, all day, we drag our burden tiring,  
                Through the coal-dark, underground —  
                Or, all day, we drive the wheels of iron  
                In the factories, round and round."
            </div>
        </li>
        <li class="poem-item">
            <strong>The Face of Freedom</strong> (Spoken Word)
            <p><em>A powerful spoken word performance that touches on themes of freedom, oppression, and the fight for equality.</em></p>
